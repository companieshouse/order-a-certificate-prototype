      <p class="govuk-body">This service is run by
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house">Companies House</a>. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>

        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text disappearing off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the service using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the service using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">We’ve also made the website text simple to understand.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">For example, if you have impaired vision and would prefer us to contact you by phone, we can call to remind you when your confirmation statement or accounts are due.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Reporting accessibility problems with this service</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">We are continuing to improve the accessibility of this service.
        <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/help/contact-us">Contact us</a>
        if you have accessibility requirements that are not listed on this page.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Enforcement procedure</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we
        respond to your complaint,
        <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Technical information about this service’s accessibility</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Companies House is committed to making its website accessible in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This service is partially compliant with the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a>
        AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">PDFs and other documents</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Many of our PDFs don’t meet accessibility standards - for example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role value). We are investigating a solution to this problem and will update this statement in due course. </p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we tested this service</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We regularly carry out internal tests for compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines V2.1 level A and level AA using a variety of manual and automated testing tools.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This service was last (externally) audited on 10 October 2017. The audit was carried out by the  <a href="https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/" class="govuk-link">Digital Accessibility Centre</a>.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">We tested:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Sign in/Register</li>
        <li>Search for a company</li>
        <li>Search for a company officer</li>
        <li>Search for a director that is disqualified</li>

      </ul>
